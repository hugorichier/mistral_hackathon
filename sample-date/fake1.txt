**Therapist:** Hi, Robert. Thanks for coming in today. How have you been feeling recently?

**Robert:** Thanks. I've been alright, I guess. I mean, nothing major has happened, but lately... I don’t know. Things just feel a bit off. I’ve been stuck in this routine, and it’s starting to wear on me.

**Therapist:** Can you say more about what feels off to you? Is it something specific at work or in your personal life?

**Robert:** Both, I think. Work’s been draining lately. I’ve been at the same job for over eight years, and it’s comfortable, you know? Stable. But I just don’t feel excited about it anymore. I applied for a promotion last year, and when I didn’t get it, it hit me harder than I thought it would. Since then, it’s like I’m just going through the motions.

**Therapist:** So, it sounds like not getting that promotion stirred up some frustration. What were you hoping that promotion would give you?

**Robert:** I guess it felt like the next step. Like, if I moved up, maybe things would feel more meaningful, or at least it’d be something different. But now, after being passed over, it’s got me questioning whether I’m doing enough or if this is all there is for me at this company.

**Therapist:** That’s understandable. It sounds like the promotion represented more than just a title for you—it was a way to break out of the routine. What about your personal life? How’s that going?

**Robert:** With Emma? It’s... I don’t know. We’ve been together for six years now, and lately, I feel like we’ve just been coasting. We don’t argue, but we don’t really talk about anything important either. We’ve settled into this routine too, like roommates more than partners. I don’t think either of us is really happy, but we’re both just comfortable.

**Therapist:** It sounds like the same sense of being "stuck" is showing up in both your personal and professional life. How do you feel about that comfort? Is it something you value, or do you think it's holding you back?

**Robert:** I used to think stability was the most important thing. I always wanted to be dependable, someone Emma could count on, and the same at work. But now, I’m not so sure. It feels like I’m just... existing. Maybe comfort’s not enough anymore, but I don’t know what to do about it.

**Therapist:** It’s natural to crave stability, but it’s also normal to want more when that stability becomes stifling. It seems like you’re feeling a bit disconnected from what gives you a sense of purpose. What’s coming up for you when you think about making a change, whether it’s in your job or with Emma?

**Robert:** Honestly? Fear. I mean, what if I try something new and fail? Or what if ending things with Emma is a mistake? We’ve built a life together, even if it’s not perfect. What if I can’t find something better? I guess I’m afraid of the unknown.

**Therapist:** That’s a powerful fear, and it’s understandable. The unknown can feel threatening, especially when you’ve built your life around stability. But it sounds like part of you is also curious about what’s on the other side of that fear. Can you see that?

**Robert:** Yeah, I guess there is. I keep thinking, “What if things could be better?” But then I get stuck worrying about how much worse they could get. It’s like I’m standing at the edge of a cliff, and I can’t tell if jumping will lead to something good or a crash landing.

**Therapist:** It sounds like there’s a tension between the fear of change and the desire for something more. Sometimes, staying in one place can feel safer, but it can also leave you unfulfilled. Have you thought about small steps you could take to explore that curiosity without making a drastic leap?

**Robert:** I’ve thought about applying for other jobs, or even trying to talk to Emma more openly about how I’m feeling. But I guess I haven’t done anything because, well... I don’t know. Part of me is waiting for something to happen, like maybe it’ll just fix itself.

**Therapist:** That’s a common feeling—waiting for something external to change things. But from what you’re saying, it seems like you already have a sense that you might need to take the first step, even if it’s a small one. What would it look like for you to explore some of those options—without feeling like everything has to change overnight?

**Robert:** Maybe I could start by looking into some professional development courses or just seeing what other opportunities are out there. And with Emma, I think I need to be more honest. I haven’t really told her how I’ve been feeling, mostly because I’m worried about where that conversation might go.

**Therapist:** That sounds like a thoughtful approach. Taking small, manageable steps could help ease some of that fear while giving you a chance to explore what you really want. And even if the conversations are difficult, they could bring some clarity.

**Robert:** Yeah, I think you’re right. I guess I just have to be willing to face that discomfort instead of avoiding it.

**Therapist:** Exactly. It’s about moving toward that discomfort at a pace that feels manageable for you. We can continue exploring how you want to approach these conversations, both at work and with Emma, so you feel more prepared. Does that sound good?

**Robert:** Yeah, it does. I think I’ve been stuck because I’m afraid of messing things up, but maybe I need to stop worrying so much about what could go wrong and focus on what might go right.

**Therapist:** That’s a great shift in mindset, Robert. Let’s keep working on that, one step at a time. You don’t have to figure it all out at once, but it sounds like you’re ready to start exploring those next steps.

**Robert:** I think I am. Thanks, this has been helpful.

**Therapist:** I’m glad to hear that. It sounds like you’re at a crossroads, and that can feel overwhelming. When you think about your next steps, what do you imagine for yourself? 

**Robert:** Honestly, I just want to feel a sense of purpose again. At work, I’d love to be involved in projects that actually matter. And in my personal life, I want to feel connected to Emma again, but I’m not sure how to bridge that gap. 

**Therapist:** That’s a good goal. Reconnecting with your sense of purpose can make a big difference in how you feel day-to-day. What would it look like to start having those conversations with Emma? 

**Robert:** I think I need to be honest about how I feel. Maybe we could go on a weekend trip or something, just the two of us, to create space for a real conversation. 

**Therapist:** That sounds like a constructive approach. Taking time away from the daily routine could help both of you open up. What about your job? Do you see any opportunities to engage with work differently, even while you’re feeling stuck?

**Robert:** I guess I could reach out to my supervisor and express my interest in taking on more responsibility or getting involved in new initiatives. But again, I’m worried about how that might come across. 

**Therapist:** It’s natural to feel hesitant, but expressing your desire to grow is a positive thing. It shows initiative and a willingness to evolve. You might be surprised by how your supervisor responds. 

**Robert:** You’re right. I think I need to take that chance. I just need to gather the courage to speak up. 

**Therapist:** And that’s completely understandable. Courage isn’t the absence of fear; it’s about moving forward despite it. Would it help if we brainstormed how to frame that conversation with your supervisor?

**Robert:** Yeah, that could be useful. I think I’d want to emphasize my commitment to the company and my desire to contribute more meaningfully. 

**Therapist:** That sounds like a solid approach. Focusing on your commitment can help demonstrate that you’re not just seeking a title but genuinely want to make an impact. 

**Robert:** I like that idea. Maybe I can also mention specific areas I’m interested in—like team leadership or project management. That might show that I’ve been thinking about it.

**Therapist:** Absolutely! Specificity can really strengthen your case. And how do you feel about setting a timeline for these conversations? It might help hold you accountable.

**Robert:** I think I could aim to have a conversation with my supervisor by the end of this month. That gives me a little time to prepare, but it’s not too far away. 

**Therapist:** That sounds like a great plan! And for your conversation with Emma, would you like to set a timeline for that as well?

**Robert:** Maybe we could plan for the weekend after next. That should give us enough time to sort out a trip. 

**Therapist:** Perfect. You’re making clear and actionable plans, which can help reduce some of the anxiety you’re feeling. How do you feel about moving forward with both of these plans?

**Robert:** Honestly, I feel a bit lighter just talking about it. I think having a plan gives me a sense of control over the situation. 

**Therapist:** That’s great to hear, Robert. It sounds like you’re starting to take ownership of your feelings and your path. As we work together, we can keep checking in on how these conversations go and how you’re feeling in the process.

**Robert:** Thanks, I appreciate that. I’m looking forward to taking these steps. 

**Therapist:** You’re welcome! Remember, progress doesn’t have to be perfect, and it’s okay to take things one step at a time. I’m here to support you as you navigate this journey.
